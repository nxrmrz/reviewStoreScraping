Mislead and disappointed,HelenEM1234,I don’t recall at all being aware the RWC semi finals and finals were going to be free to air when I bought the tournament pass.  I feel totally mislead in this regard.  The pool matches were glitchy.  Really regret this purchase.,2019-10-28T15:05:14-07:00,1
Worse than ever,Qu1nnie,"I’m disappointed i can’t rate 0 stars for this, as it deserves no rating. The app is worse than ever and buggy, being so full of corporate greed i’m surprised you are able to see or understand anything beyond your selfish little world. Can’t watch anything without having to reset the internet, login 10 times and then disappointedly watch the audio and video out of sync, laggy and terrible quality. 

Anyone who made the decision to release this app and push forward with it should be locked up and the key thrown away. Congratulations on ruining a countries sporting support, with one flick of a switch. I feel bad for anyone working on this project, and I apologise for you having to read this. But your ‘higher-ups’ are terrible greedy selfish disgraces to this Nation. They deserve to be known and all the hate directed on them rather than the frantically working coders who have been thrown unceremoniously into this. 

Have a terrible day

The next it’s an invalid response received from manifest request Status code 403 3006. Has been a very poor customer experience where I’ve seen more errors than games when trying to use the app. Not impressed as it’s operated like a beta while the full price is charged to customers. ‘Tis the sad reality of the predatory nature of the market nowadays as they know customers will pay regardless.,2019-10-13T04:39:31-07:00,1
Overreaching,jpq#,"This is the first review I’ve ever given on anything. Why? Why did you decide to do this when it’s obvious you can’t?

The app continually crashes, the picture quality is appalling and I even had the famous green and purple lines for the first time. And it’s not my set up because sometimes - maybe 25% - it all works fine with good quality picture. The app is a disgrace and whoever made the “bold audacious” decision to go for it should hang their head in shame. Or has he left already?",2019-10-13T00:58:55-07:00,1
Speed is ok. But functionality does not work properly,noyb...nz,"Very poor functionality overall

Going through the menus is difficult on a Apple TV despite the fact that this app has been recently released

Many things do NOT work in the way that you would expect and on top of that there are errors

For example when you attempt to go into a LIVE match and select “play from the start”, this does not work and jumps you to the current time to watch it Live so instead of going to enjoy the full match in one case I jumped into it at 68 minutes and 44 seconds. Really poor that Something this obvious was not tested.

Spark, raise your game, and stop being so arrogant. You are no longer a monopoly.
Luckily I don’t like cricket so I will be using this any RWC",2019-10-13T00:26:47-07:00,2

I was smart enough to check whether it worked before the big tournament (you know which one i mean) it didn’t, found Spark customer service to be unhelpful, took two weeks for them to get back to me... By then i had figured it out myself, I had ended up buying a newer Chromecast.

Useless,Dirtypetenz,"App performs poorly, looks good from a UI perspective but the back end is terrible.

Week before the biggest rugby event, letter arrives saying we can’t watch due to the internet at our place (provided by spark who own Spark sport). Now this is an issue but not sparks sports, so I made arrangements to view at a mates place who has 100/20. So I know that’s good. This is where the troubles start. 

Picture quality is terrible,  stutters and looses picture all the time, the 3 dots of death (buffering) and audio issues, and that’s just so far. This company were not prepared to put development into this app or the back end and have been blaming everyone or thing for the issues. The overseas streaming is done by Akamai, who appear to know what they are doing but the app constantly freezes and crashes. I’ve turned the auto update on, deleted it and reinstalled it, then not used the app and used the website and got the same results.

I should have read the reviews that pointed out constant streaming issues with smaller events. I have no faith this will be fixed without the company ducking for cover, and anticipate a copy and paste reply or passive aggressive reply about this review. Check their Facebook page for more info about the app issues and streaming issues, but be aware, they are deleting people’s comments. 

Poor effort spark sport, poor streaming and crashes has ruined the RWC for us all.",2019-10-06T02:03:23-07:00,1

Minus 5 Stars,Smbazalo,"An absolute piece of sh**. 

Spent half the RWC games watching it buffer. Swapping in an out from just about acceptable quality to crappy 20 pixels on the screen quality. Or having to restart it cause the stream crapped itself.

Designed well. But unusable for watching the World Cup when it comes to the connection of the stream.

Only slight issue is the noticeable artefacting on the grass/field when the wide angle camera pans left or right ( in the World Cup rugby 2019)

Very limited app,hexeyman,"Updated review
I reviewed this several months ago during the beta release and a free trial, giving it 2 out of 5. Coming back to it recently not much has changed.

On the plus side:
-Picture quality is good on my iPhone and laptop. There are occasional pauses for buffering but nothing serious with my 100mbs fibre connection. That is the plus points done with. 

On the negative side:
- There is no search function meaning it is difficult to find what you want quickly.
- There is no way to identify the sports and events of interest to you meaning the home page is dominated with irrelevant content.
- Sound consistently becomes out of sync with the picture. The longer the event the greater the difference. For example, at the end of a 2 hour Grand Prix this is a 5 to 10 second difference. Reloading the stream doesn’t fix it.
- It is impossible to purchase access for individual sports events. You need to pay full price for everything even if you don’t want it. Interested in a particular grand prix or football match but don’t want to pay for the whole service? Tough. Pay for everything or get nothing. It is an outdated business model which doesn’t fit a streaming service. 

I still cannot recommend this product. It needs significant improvements to deliver and consistent product and pricing model which welcomes those with a passing interest to watch instead of serving die hard fans.",2019-09-29T15:54:01-07:00,2
App is pointless,teeelesssa,Not recommended if you want to watch Rugby World Cup. Wasted money on this. Also it kept dropping off my casting options. So there were times where I couldn’t stream to the tv had to watch it on my phone.,2019-09-28T07:18:00-07:00,1

Not a Good Experience,eracode,"Subscribed for RWC. Watching games on-demand at off-peak times, many times during a game the picture pixelates and freezes. Also the picture is continuously switching in and out of HD all though a game. Overall not a great experience.

Watching via ultrafast fibre, iPad Pro > Chromecast > 2018 LG OLED TV.

Spark Sport promised there would be an app for this TV so we paid for the app in good faith - then they reneged on their promise. Unimpressed.

Edit: Just watched our first live game - JPN v IRE. More pixelation, freezing, buffering. Very frustrating. About half the game was at less than HD resolution. Simply not good enough. Have changed rating from 2- to 1-star.",2019-09-28T02:53:42-07:00,1

Not many options to control bandwidth evident, stream would degrade whenever there was a lot of movement, which happens a lot in sport. Not entirely sparks fault, but it would be good to be able to manually adjust bandwidth/quality.

Menu system still a bit cluttered and confusing for me. 

Biggest issue for me is that live streams are out of sync. Audio consistently 2 seconds behind the video. I tried to fix it by looking at spark FAQ and help pages. Absolutely nothing there other than a rather condescending suggestion that I check that my decide isn’t muted. Checked google for similar apps with this issue and did that, didn’t fix it.

The developer refers users to a website to register, the website insists on payment information being added to one’s account before registration can be completed.

Given we’ve been told via the media that this initial stage is really intended for beta testing, the perceived risk of forgetting about canceling the 30 day trial prior to charges being applied will, I imagine, turn a significant number of potential users (test subjects) off completing their registrations

This will also fail because Spark think that they just have to buy up the rights and not bother with the having people see it part.

The app also has a few hours of dead screen before qualifying started so you had to fast forward to where you thought it should start and hope you didn’t over shoot it. Fast forward it’s self didn’t work. When we first got on to qualifying and it took us to the live view we couldn’t rewind at all without the app jumping right back to live mode.
