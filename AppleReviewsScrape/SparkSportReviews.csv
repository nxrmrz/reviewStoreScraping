Pretty good,Dollynz,"I have had very few issues with this app watching F1 and the RWC.  Good coverage, happy with it so far.",2019-11-16T23:30:49-07:00,4
No problems at all,Kiwi201902,"While I have heard a lot of people had issues streaming the RWC, I have personally have had no problems at all in streaming live or watching recorded shows. I suspect it is the users broadband connection which might be to blame.",2019-11-04T18:31:16-07:00,5
Awful,tmodeadman,The biggest piece of junk I‚Äôve ever had the displeasure of using. Cancelling my subscription.,2019-11-03T11:22:08-07:00,1
Hangs in the advertisements and transitions,Phonia,"Still very much beta stage, regularly hangs and have to manually back up and press play to restart.",2019-11-01T01:33:59-07:00,1
Mislead and disappointed,HelenEM1234,I don‚Äôt recall at all being aware the RWC semi finals and finals were going to be free to air when I bought the tournament pass.  I feel totally mislead in this regard.  The pool matches were glitchy.  Really regret this purchase.,2019-10-28T15:05:14-07:00,1
Worse than ever,Qu1nnie,"I‚Äôm disappointed i can‚Äôt rate 0 stars for this, as it deserves no rating. The app is worse than ever and buggy, being so full of corporate greed i‚Äôm surprised you are able to see or understand anything beyond your selfish little world. Can‚Äôt watch anything without having to reset the internet, login 10 times and then disappointedly watch the audio and video out of sync, laggy and terrible quality. 

Anyone who made the decision to release this app and push forward with it should be locked up and the key thrown away. Congratulations on ruining a countries sporting support, with one flick of a switch. I feel bad for anyone working on this project, and I apologise for you having to read this. But your ‚Äòhigher-ups‚Äô are terrible greedy selfish disgraces to this Nation. They deserve to be known and all the hate directed on them rather than the frantically working coders who have been thrown unceremoniously into this. 

Have a terrible day

Yours truly,

New Zealand",2019-10-26T14:14:02-07:00,1
Excellent step forward,G Tr,"Great App. Works very well. Kiwis needs to grow up and accept the change and stop winging.

"Can‚Äôt even sign in, useless.",lannie16,"Downloaded app, won‚Äôt accept my spark app password, so tried to reset password. It says it has sent me an email. Don‚Äôt know where it‚Äôs sent it to, because I didn‚Äôt get it.",2019-10-20T03:35:08-07:00,1

Won‚Äôt stream to Apple TV,Adhfgj,"Reasonably expensive for something that works sometimes. It‚Äôs ok if your watching a movie and it buffers a little bit but I‚Äôve ended up watching the World Cup at a mates house who has a VPN 

won‚Äôt stream content to Apple TV either which is a bit of a bbq stopper",2019-10-16T01:14:42-07:00,1
Reliable App,rollingdowns,"I use the app daily through AppleTV, iPad and occasionally iPhone. Had an issue pre-world cup telling me I had too many devices logged in. Logged out, deleted app and reloaded and no problems whatsoever since. Only real bugbear is no opportunity to download and watch offline, given I spend 3hrs a day commuting I really need this",2019-10-15T19:52:54-07:00,4
"Cheaper than sky, but for far less actual rugby",steve9ace,Error after error every time I try watch using the mobile app. One time it‚Äôs telling me I‚Äôm not in New Zealand when I‚Äôm sitting at home in Auckland. The next it‚Äôs an invalid response received from manifest request Status code 403 3006. Has been a very poor customer experience where I‚Äôve seen more errors than games when trying to use the app. Not impressed as it‚Äôs operated like a beta while the full price is charged to customers. ‚ÄòTis the sad reality of the predatory nature of the market nowadays as they know customers will pay regardless.,2019-10-13T04:39:31-07:00,1
Overreaching,jpq#,"This is the first review I‚Äôve ever given on anything. Why? Why did you decide to do this when it‚Äôs obvious you can‚Äôt? Yet again my planned RWC evening has already been ruined and I‚Äôm only a third of the way through. The app continually crashes, the picture quality is appalling and I even had the famous green and purple lines for the first time. And it‚Äôs not my set up because sometimes - maybe 25% - it all works fine with good quality picture. The app is a disgrace and whoever made the ‚Äúbold audacious‚Äù decision to go for it should hang their head in shame. Or has he left already?",2019-10-13T00:58:55-07:00,1
Speed is ok. But functionality does not work properly,noyb...nz,"Very poor functionality overall

Going through the menus is difficult on a Apple TV despite the fact that this app has been recently released

Many things do NOT work in the way that you would expect and on top of that there are errors

For example when you attempt to go into a LIVE match and select ‚Äúplay from the start‚Äù, this does not work and jumps you to the current time to watch it Live so instead of going to enjoy the full match in one case I jumped into it at 68 minutes and 44 seconds. Really poor that Something this obvious was not tested.

Spark, raise your game, and stop being so arrogant. You are no longer a monopoly.
Luckily I don‚Äôt like cricket so I will be using this any RWC",2019-10-13T00:26:47-07:00,2
Haaaard to use,Ventola84,"Hi Spark. 
Whoever developed the app. Please, get a refund and find someone else who is professional developer. 

This app is no logical at all, like a high school student graduate product who made overnight. 

Find someone oversea who can make a proper app. Please, or we have to unsubscribe it.",2019-10-10T03:41:43-07:00,1
Very good app,cat is best friend,Haven‚Äôt got any problem with this app. Can use this at multiple devices and it works fine with chrome cast as well. Love it! Good work spark people!,2019-10-08T01:05:35-07:00,5
Just awful....,otago bill,"I knew this would be an absolute mess but I don‚Äôt feel vindicated being proved right. Clunky, unresponsive, unintuitive junk from our mates at Spark. Feel sorry for the people who have to work there. 

Up your game spark and don‚Äôt you dare bid for rugby, cricket or americas cup!",2019-10-07T21:29:39-07:00,1
getting more stable with each update.,Rahnos,"Since recent updates the app has been working fine for live streaming and casting to Chromecast.
I was smart enough to check whether it worked before the big tournament (you know which one i mean) it didn‚Äôt, found Spark customer service to be unhelpful, took two weeks for them to get back to me... By then i had figured it out myself, I had ended up buying a newer Chromecast.
Have experienced NO streaming issues since the app updates pre tournament.
The negative media coverage is becoming ridiculous...",2019-10-07T11:32:18-07:00,4
Works great,whakatanesam,Big upgrade on Bein sports app for the EPL last year. rWC has been flawless for me.,2019-10-07T11:27:14-07:00,5
Terrible.,Sea Kiwi,"It‚Äôs a shockingly bad app. What‚Äôs even worse is it‚Äôs not even formatted to fit the iPhone plus / max series phones. The app fits the screen but when a game is on there are these horrible grey bars reducing screen real estate. 

Terrible all round.",2019-10-07T11:21:24-07:00,1
Useless,Dirtypetenz,"App performs poorly, looks good from a UI perspective but the back end is terrible.

Week before the biggest rugby event, letter arrives saying we can‚Äôt watch due to the internet at our place (provided by spark who own Spark sport). Now this is an issue but not sparks sports, so I made arrangements to view at a mates place who has 100/20. So I know that‚Äôs good. This is where the troubles start. 

Picture quality is terrible,  stutters and looses picture all the time, the 3 dots of death (buffering) and audio issues, and that‚Äôs just so far. This company were not prepared to put development into this app or the back end and have been blaming everyone or thing for the issues. The overseas streaming is done by Akamai, who appear to know what they are doing but the app constantly freezes and crashes. I‚Äôve turned the auto update on, deleted it and reinstalled it, then not used the app and used the website and got the same results.

I should have read the reviews that pointed out constant streaming issues with smaller events. I have no faith this will be fixed without the company ducking for cover, and anticipate a copy and paste reply or passive aggressive reply about this review. Check their Facebook page for more info about the app issues and streaming issues, but be aware, they are deleting people‚Äôs comments. 

Poor effort spark sport, poor streaming and crashes has ruined the RWC for us all.",2019-10-06T02:03:23-07:00,1
Absolutely average,ghost shagger,Watching delayed World Cup games an you can‚Äôt fast forward ads at half time or rewind to see tries or incidents that have happened. A simple update of this would help. Frustrating at all hell,2019-10-05T23:47:05-07:00,1
Smooth stream,LJE96,No problems streaming via chromecast/iPhone on VDSL and fibre connections made affordable compared to getting locked into a contract with sky,2019-10-05T21:41:50-07:00,5
Minus 5 Stars,Smbazalo,"An absolute piece of sh**. 

Spent half the RWC games watching it buffer. Swapping in an out from just about acceptable quality to crappy 20 pixels on the screen quality. Or having to restart it cause the stream crapped itself.

Designed well. But unusable for watching the World Cup when it comes to the connection of the stream.

Not bad... but,KIWI330,"Haven‚Äôt had too many problem‚Äôs but for some reason if you try to start watching game a little after kick off it doesn‚Äôt work. It only says coverage will start shortly. Real pain as I‚Äôve missed the first 15-20 minutes of a few games during the RWC because after some time it gets annoying and switch the live feed. 
Other than that the picture quality is normally very good, I do have very good fibre though.",2019-10-02T01:24:09-07:00,3

Good,HouseCat88,"Looking great at 1080p 60fps on my chromecast ultra. 
Only slight issue is the noticeable artefacting on the grass/field when the wide angle camera pans left or right ( in the World Cup rugby 2019)

It may be a technical stretch but if you could bump the bitrate to 10Mbps I think the picture would look outstanding üôÇüëçüèª",2019-09-29T19:38:00-07:00,4
Unreliable,JohnlivesinNZ,Sometimes when watching using airplay it will work fine but half the time when I close my phone it will exit out of the live or recorded game and I will have to reconnect and find my place. I use Fibre internet so isn‚Äôt an internet issue ... :(,2019-09-29T17:49:29-07:00,2
Very limited app,hexeyman,"Updated review
I reviewed this several months ago during the beta release and a free trial, giving it 2 out of 5. Coming back to it recently not much has changed.

On the plus side:
-Picture quality is good on my iPhone and laptop. There are occasional pauses for buffering but nothing serious with my 100mbs fibre connection. That is the plus points done with. 

On the negative side:
- There is no search function meaning it is difficult to find what you want quickly.
- There is no way to identify the sports and events of interest to you meaning the home page is dominated with irrelevant content.
- Sound consistently becomes out of sync with the picture. The longer the event the greater the difference. For example, at the end of a 2 hour Grand Prix this is a 5 to 10 second difference. Reloading the stream doesn‚Äôt fix it.
- It is impossible to purchase access for individual sports events. You need to pay full price for everything even if you don‚Äôt want it. Interested in a particular grand prix or football match but don‚Äôt want to pay for the whole service? Tough. Pay for everything or get nothing. It is an outdated business model which doesn‚Äôt fit a streaming service. 

I still cannot recommend this product. It needs significant improvements to deliver and consistent product and pricing model which welcomes those with a passing interest to watch instead of serving die hard fans.",2019-09-29T15:54:01-07:00,2
App is pointless,teeelesssa,Not recommended if you want to watch Rugby World Cup. Wasted money on this. Also it kept dropping off my casting options. So there were times where I couldn‚Äôt stream to the tv had to watch it on my phone.,2019-09-28T07:18:00-07:00,1
Rubbish,hatespark,"It casting ok sometimes and not other times...don't have any issues casting Netflix, Neon etc...just Spark Sports. Spark has ruined Sports viewing in NZ",2019-09-28T05:04:56-07:00,1
Not a Good Experience,eracode,"Subscribed for RWC. Watching games on-demand at off-peak times, many times during a game the picture pixelates and freezes. Also the picture is continuously switching in and out of HD all though a game. Overall not a great experience.

Watching via ultrafast fibre, iPad Pro > Chromecast > 2018 LG OLED TV.

Spark Sport promised there would be an app for this TV so we paid for the app in good faith - then they reneged on their promise. Unimpressed.

Edit: Just watched our first live game - JPN v IRE. More pixelation, freezing, buffering. Very frustrating. About half the game was at less than HD resolution. Simply not good enough. Have changed rating from 2- to 1-star.",2019-09-28T02:53:42-07:00,1
Can‚Äôt log in,magnoliabl,"Can‚Äôt log in on my phone, even though it works fine on my laptop (and I‚Äôm logged out on my laptop, been through all the troubleshooting). Got the same problem on the TV today even though the TV worked fine previously. Rubbish!",2019-09-28T02:05:18-07:00,1

Really poor on all levels,Farrofresh,"Really poor app - but even more so absolutely terrible marketing ads. Seriously - someone shouting ‚ÄòSpark sport‚Äô over and over?

Very poor option - find something else,ffthjvhjvghjctyjkgu,"Update: extremely poor handling. You should never have taken on this service if you could not handle it. I‚Äôm happy it‚Äôs working for some people, but the buffering and freezing makes live sport unwatchable for others, including me.
