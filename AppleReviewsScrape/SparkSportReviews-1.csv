Clunky,mtcp99,‚ÄúWatch from beginning‚Äù  option takes you to ‚ÄúLive‚Äù. So you see the score - not great.  ‚ÄúBack 10‚Äù and ‚Äúforward 10‚Äù buttons intermittently disappear.

A bit shonky,Baudcranium,"Tried to watch RWC opening ceremony last night. Clicked the button watch from beginning. Waited. ""Please stay tuned scheduled program will start shortly"".

Beware,Elkabyle,"Beware if you want to suspend your subscription... spark won‚Äôt let you watch any content from the date you cancel, NOT from the end of your billing cycle, unlike others like beIN or Netflix.
I suspended my account a week before the end of my cycle, thinking I could watch another week. No luck. And they don‚Äôt want to give a partial refund. They still treat customers very badly. 
Would not recommend for that reason.",2019-09-15T22:49:00-07:00,1

"Hopeless, it‚Äôs useless for the rugby World Cup.",the big fletch,"$89 for an app that won‚Äôt run on my Apple TV 4. I have the correct app and correct Apple TV but it refuses to accept my password. 
I tried to live chat for help but it‚Äôs closed for the night, no help. 
The help page is of no help.
I have updated my Apple TV, it‚Äôs good to go. But the app is hopeless, it won‚Äôt logon. Don‚Äôt buy it, it‚Äôs not worth the money for the rugby World Cup.",2019-09-14T01:59:29-07:00,1
Worst streaming experience ever - too restrictive,Danger Mouze,"Tells me I‚Äôm using in too many devices. I‚Äôve only ever used on my phone and one pc. I log out my sky sport account on the pc and closed the browser. Open the app and it says I cannot watch - too many devices in use. There are no (zero) other devices in use. I understand the desire to stop sharing, but this is blocking legitimate paid for usage. Very very poor. If I need to go out part way through watching the game and want to transfer to my phone to continue watching, I won‚Äôt be able to.",2019-09-13T02:44:09-07:00,3

Complete utter joke!!!,Liamdiam,"This has got to be one of the worst experiences I‚Äôve ever had trying to watch EPL. Didn‚Äôt manage to catch the start of the game live so tried clicking ‚Äúwatch from the start‚Äù and it sent me to the live playback anyway, giving me the score I spent 2 hours successfully ignoring. The week previous it kept logging out during the live broadcast, almost every 15 minutes. Maybe you should have spent more money developing the app rather than buying the rights to the sporting events you quite clearly aren‚Äôt capable of broadcasting.",2019-08-24T13:02:48-07:00,1
Ripped off,7SMV7,Tried the 7 day trial. Poor experience so cancelled. I cancelled on day 8 so they took a months subscription which is fair enough but even though I have paid for the month apparently I don't have an active subscription. Help desk is appalling. Good luck with the World Cup. My advice is keep your money.,2019-08-24T04:18:59-07:00,1
"Potential, but limited options at present",ExcusesofPuppets,"Promising, but doesn‚Äôt seem ready.

Not many options to control bandwidth evident, stream would degrade whenever there was a lot of movement, which happens a lot in sport. Not entirely sparks fault, but it would be good to be able to manually adjust bandwidth/quality.

Menu system still a bit cluttered and confusing for me. 

Biggest issue for me is that live streams are out of sync. Audio consistently 2 seconds behind the video. I tried to fix it by looking at spark FAQ and help pages. Absolutely nothing there other than a rather condescending suggestion that I check that my decide isn‚Äôt muted. Checked google for similar apps with this issue and did that, didn‚Äôt fix it.

So I can‚Äôt continue with a sub at this stage. The audio is just too annoying. When this is fixed I‚Äôll reconsider.",2019-08-23T14:35:15-07:00,2

It‚Äôll have to get a lot better than this in time for the RWC.",2019-08-09T14:21:44-07:00,2
