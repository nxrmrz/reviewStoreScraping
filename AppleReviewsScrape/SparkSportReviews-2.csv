Registration,Sam2076,Am I missing something or is there no registration button?,2019-07-12T00:49:36-07:00,1
Nothing like it advertises,I'm Brian,The $19.99 subscription is a Utter waste of money. Very few sports options. Rather pay for sky and get the satisfaction.,2019-07-10T13:44:46-07:00,1
Thanks for the Apple TV app!,Kryten NZ,"Great work getting the Apple TV app out the door! 

Unfortunately playback isn’t as smooth as you competitors (yet) and uh, where’s the on screen score and clock in the RWC games that are available?",2019-07-09T23:00:11-07:00,4
Apple TV,MitchSin19,Is really glitchy when trying to use through Apple TV. Keeps stoping and losing its place. Seems to have started with new update.,2019-07-01T00:54:50-07:00,3
Just sound .. no video,001suri01,When I connect phone to tv via hdmi.. just sound no video... what’s d solution..??,2019-06-20T15:38:29-07:00,1
Yuk,Supasoaker75,"Not a user friendly app. Can’t turn subscriptions on and off in the app. Each time I’ve wanted to use it I’m on the chat and have to reinstall it. 

All this from someone who was a paying user!

Good luck with the World Cup, your going to need it if my experience is anything to go by.",2019-06-13T00:31:01-07:00,1
Casting problem,alau90,"Most of the time, I am having issues casting formula one on the Chromecast, but it works on the mobile device. Are you guys able to fix the issue? If this keeps up I'm unsubscribing spark sports.",2019-06-07T14:09:45-07:00,1
Needs more content,Rockybainski,"Very limited amount of hockey, particularly looking for the European games eg Belgium vs Germany.

Also lags when watching f1. If this is the only option for RWC I suspect the nation will be very disappointed",2019-06-07T03:23:46-07:00,1
App doesn’t work,toomuchadsruingames,"Every time I try logging in it say there’s a login error, tried multiple times and still the same issue. Tried signing in online and the screen just goes back. Hopefully this isn’t an issue when the rwc is on",2019-06-01T14:08:27-07:00,1
Terrible,Golfboy-72,"Spark should be ashamed of this app. Quality is terrible... pushed for RWC, yet cannot AirPlay to an Apple TV despite saying it does. Can’t give a lower rating otherwise I would...",2019-05-30T01:37:52-07:00,1
Ok but needs work,Zunk01,Even though I am logged in and have purchased a Rugby Tournament Pass I am getting ads asking me to purchase one - confusing and unnecessary.,2019-05-26T15:38:52-07:00,3
Flips to sideways orientation on iPad,LiveMC,Impossible to watch - app rotates itself sideways when iPad Pro is in standard landscape mode ready for video.,2019-05-25T00:12:54-07:00,1
Not loading,wwyypppi,Just a blank screen when trying to load videos just now,2019-05-24T22:29:27-07:00,2
Landscape mode poor on ipad,TigersRugbyFan,"The app on iPad only presents its UI in portrait mode, but who wants to watch tv like that? Sure, landscape works after you hit playback, but you keep having to rotate your iPad when going between playback and doing anything else. Poor design, but should be easy to fix. Hopefully will be done before RWC.",2019-05-20T01:26:20-07:00,2
Rubbish,crazydogs3,"Worst app I have ever used. If I could watch formula one any other way I would ditch this app in a heartbeat. Glitchy, freezes, takes forever to even start. Spark sport need to get their act together and provide something that works reliably for the costs. Absolute rubbish!",2019-05-11T14:54:10-07:00,1
Poor,siftycat,"No smart TV apps, no Xbox or PS4 apps, and this poor quality app requires extra hardware to mirror to a TV. Two months in and no sign of any other apps. Premier League Pass, Bein Sports and Sky Sports Fan Pass are all failures because companies don't get that customers want a consistent delivery system. This will also fail because Spark think that they just have to buy up the rights and not bother with the having people see it part. If I buy extra hardware to watch the stuff Spark bought the rights to but didn't bother working on the delivery system then that's my budget blown and I'll just have to carry on using free streams.

Your move, Spark.",2019-05-10T15:56:13-07:00,1
Constantly glitches,nique021,"This app is very average. Constantly stops playing, or audio continues while pic freezes. Very frustrating when ur watching something.",2019-05-06T01:36:14-07:00,2
Portrait,peecee09,"This app must be altered so it can be viewed in landscape format, not portrait. So old fashioned. The same applies to your My Spark apps.So many hiccups need remedial action in such a short time !",2019-04-30T21:37:12-07:00,1
Suggestions for improvement,Nikadma,"Hello, be helpful if there was an in app feedback section. Also if you could set reminders for events in the future.",2019-04-24T15:33:50-07:00,3
Long way to go !,Flergiswan,Seems like a beta app. The app just crashed after clicking on the NBA icon I restarted then it did it again. Worked 3rd time lucky.,2019-04-22T13:31:18-07:00,1
Spark Sport,Seini,Most apps that require login give an account creation option. Not Spark Sport! Just a login in option. As a spark customer I tried my spark account credentials-no joy!! What’s the point of an app that requires login if you can’t create one?,2019-04-21T21:38:55-07:00,1
"Poor, if you have an iPad",MikeT60,"Treats mobile devices like a phone, but I watch my streaming sport in landscape on my iPad.

How hard is it to develop for both platforms? 

Also, spark sports website is primitive - sign up doesn’t have any modern HTML tags for pref-filling name, address, card details etc.

Get with it spark. At the moment you’re not impressing.",2019-04-15T23:57:41-07:00,1
Very buggy with Apple TV,Camionista33,Will delete after free trial if functionality doesn't improve. Currently very unreliable.,2019-04-14T00:50:01-07:00,2
Pathetic app,Niiiceguy,"1. Doesn’t tell you if you’re being charged when you download the app (hope I wasn’t charged ☠️
2. Doesn’t tell you or explain how to sign. 
3. Misleading (very)",2019-04-13T22:53:55-07:00,1
Bit of a hit and miss with this app.,Alexmichaelwatson,"Casting to a big screen via sharing is a bit tricky. Worked one day, next day it doesn’t. Playback is good",2019-04-13T22:40:53-07:00,2
Spark Sport,JoniP,"Needs a message on opening App that you must sign up on
Web browser. Nearly gave up trying to work that out. Basics are important developers!!
REALLY NEEDS a forward and back 10sec shuffle button like Netflix & Amazon Prime. 
To get a professional sport viewing App they should study how Dorma does MotoGP App. Bookmarks are sorely missed here.",2019-04-13T22:18:55-07:00,3
Does most things I wanted.,fntjv#@$,"Some are quick to criticise without fully exploring the functionality of the app. 
The only shortcoming seems to be that when casting, the resume point on the (iPad) doesn’t synch with the true point in a replay if the iPad has been locked during replay. 
Or am I also jumping to a false assumption?",2019-04-02T20:12:52-07:00,3
Missed the ball,moresand,Got up early to watch F1 took us an hour to try and get it loaded had to watch first half on small iPhone as wouldn't go to start of programme if connected to tv then showed live and spoilt the result before we even started watching. once finished live we screened on tv. Really hard to rewind accurately with just a tiny line on iPhone. You should have had it fully sorted prior to start of season -give it to duke or fully back to sky including the practises and preshows. Only got app for F1. Looking for any other options to watch,2019-04-02T14:29:34-07:00,2
“Play from start” function is not working,F1 Fan Forza,"Tried to watch F1 this morning. The button “watch from start” is not working. When chosen , took me to live screen and spoiled the results.",2019-03-31T09:48:10-07:00,1
Failed again,Quality.……,"For the second week of trying to watch F1, the app has failed to deliver. Constantly buffering the video feed, casting to the big screen from iPad and the program jumps out of time and fails to show anything. After reloading the app on the iPhone and iPad this problem continues. 

I’d like to think before any monthly subscriptions are taken they will address this failing app.",2019-03-30T13:28:47-07:00,1
Needs weekly updates,Bobbyhi,There’s no search function so trying to find what you want to watch comes down to blindly swiping around hoping what you want to watch appears. Still cuts to random still pictures through f1 practices. Still have hope though.,2019-03-30T13:08:12-07:00,2
Not ready for public use,jeds dad,"Having waited to watch F1 practice 1 decided to try practice 2 still unable to watch spark please advise how long is
“Stay tunes coverage begins shortly”
How long is shortly?",2019-03-29T13:49:39-07:00,1
Poor on chrome cast,michels16,Frequently video cuts out on chrome cast. Watching on high speed internet and chrome cast doesn’t fail on other apps sites we use. Also even when using the iPad the video cuts out and all that is on screen is the f1 and sky sports logo along with audio.,2019-03-29T12:37:48-07:00,2
How to register,thitcvjutcvv,"Hi, how can I register for this app. I’ve downloaded it but I only see login not sign up..",2019-03-19T02:57:55-07:00,1
Well Done,e3ra,"Great app. I had wonderful experience with the app watching F1.
Only issue is AirPlay dropping off if I receive calls on my phone",2019-03-18T15:21:59-07:00,5
Potential,TheKashmeister,"From my usage of Spark Sports, it is a new app and there are some flaws and hiccups. However, for a brand new app, I am happy with the performance of it. I look forward to Spark Sports growing and continue to fine-tune the app and seamless streaming and catch-up to combat the criminal pricing and lacklustre performance of Sky Sports.",2019-03-18T00:15:39-07:00,4
Airplay,KarlNZ,"Apple airplay did not work, hard watching on the iphone..",2019-03-17T10:07:43-07:00,2
Need way more sport,Appl3Pies,Pretty impressed with the app itself but the content is lacking so far.,2019-03-17T05:28:26-07:00,4
Has potential,Boredtaxi,"The start from beginning feature doesn’t seem to be working which is disappointing.

We wanted to watch the F1 and missed the first 25 laps. 

Other than that the stream is pretty good, no lag issues, constant high quality picture.

The menu could use a little work. Looking forward to see how this develops before the rugby World Cup.",2019-03-17T00:08:19-07:00,2
App crash!!!!,DewaldNZ,"After a few minutes of viewing F1 in all the sessions, the app keeps crashing!!
Please fix urgently because it’s utterly annoying!! 1 star rating at most!!!!!!!",2019-03-16T22:26:27-07:00,1
UI design 101,Burfot,"Honour my orientation settings. 
But wait: Spark knows better...
Sky had the same attitude....",2019-03-16T22:10:03-07:00,1
Portrait Only?,Joshynz,"I know the service is in Beta, but being portrait only on iPad while navigating the app is highly annoying!
Otherwise the stream and video quality seems good.
I’m a little confused with the portrait only as a swear when I initially downloaded the app it was also landscape? Maybe I was imagining it.",2019-03-16T17:21:52-07:00,3
Potential but lack of functions,Asasul,The app need work to improve functions such as notifications and a calendar to allow you to locate relevant items to watch. Currently the f1 qualification doesn’t show up immediately after the session has finished - and it’s been over an hour since the season finished. Not good enough.,2019-03-16T01:49:47-07:00,2
Lacks some basic functions,mclovin nz,Can’t watch a stream which is in progress from the start of the broadcast when using chromecast.  iPad app lets me go back to the start but when I start casting it only shows the live coverage and I can’t jump to earlier in the broadcast.,2019-03-16T01:07:59-07:00,1
What a hassle,Are you kidding...,"After spending about an hour trying to resolve an issue with credit card details not having been loaded in the first instance to start the free trial (and not being able to load these at a later time), it finally launched, then I found out there is no app for smart tvs, then the website wouldn’t load on the web browser for the tv, then when I set my computer up with an HDMI link to the TV, it crashed!  Then I watched only half of the qualifying series for F1 on Duke with very poor picture.",2019-03-16T00:54:00-07:00,1
This is a horrible app,john 1029384756,I was going to go watch formula 1 qualifying and we clicked the watch from beginning option and it took us to the live view spoiling the results ruining everything. The app also has a few hours of dead screen before qualifying started so you had to fast forward to where you thought it should start and hope you didn’t over shoot it. Fast forward it’s self didn’t work. When we first got on to qualifying and it took us to the live view we couldn’t rewind at all without the app jumping right back to live mode. This is one of the biggest disappointments in an app I’ve ever seen. It’s completely useless.,2019-03-16T00:18:29-07:00,1
No Commentary for F1??,Kiwi Dave 345,"Picture quality seems good early in the morning without many users online, but why is there no commentary for the F1 practices??
Surely Spark didn’t cut corners and buy broadcast rights without commentary??!!!
WRC is the full format. Nice to be able to binge watch highlight packages",2019-03-15T12:16:25-07:00,1
Commentary?,my.name.jiff,Just watching the first F1 practice of the season trying to get an insight into this year and there is no commentary?! Did Spark not buy the rights to this? What’s the story here and when will this improve?,2019-03-14T20:19:43-07:00,2
Has potential but needs work to make it stable,Hduejebriskwjsh,"After taking a while to resolve account issues, in the first F1 practice session the app crashed once, failed to stream another time and during the course of the whole session repeatedly had the audio cutting out. I’m watching on high speed connection so i doubt the issue from my connection. The app interface is decent, though you have to manage account externally to the app and appears to require a pc - it couldn’t change app settings on phone browser. There is good potential but this is clearly an early release. By the way, quite nice to have so many 5 star reviews before the app even went live which are clearly bogus. Rather than patting yourselves on the back, please work on improving it! There’s no way this is close to 5 stars and you know it.",2019-03-14T19:40:43-07:00,2
Unable to setup,YrREguy,"It asks me to logon but I’m not even registered?
When I go Thru the process I ask to reset password and it’s unable to do that right now.
How can Apple even let this on the store when it’s so buggy or not working",2019-03-14T16:27:34-07:00,1
