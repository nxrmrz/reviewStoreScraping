No AirPlay,Hack778899,How come it wonâ€™t work on my Apple TV as promised?,2019-03-14T01:34:38-07:00,1
Portrait???,dupka,"Ummmm - a portrait only app? Is this 2010 when the iPad 1st gen was launched? I never hold my iPad in portrait because, you know, it has a Smart Keyboard. You want to look into it - I know it's very difficult to keep up with all the new technology.

And no background playing of video? I know, I know, it's my fault for having a nice new iPad Pro that can multi-task. I should have just stuck with the 1st gen and stop watching the live sport to be able to check my email.",2019-03-14T01:27:34-07:00,2

Good start,BarelyAnEmber,"As many others have noted, there is no way to register via the app.
The developer refers users to a website to register, the website insists on payment information being added to oneâ€™s account before registration can be completed.

Given weâ€™ve been told via the media that this initial stage is really intended for beta testing, the perceived risk of forgetting about canceling the 30 day trial prior to charges being applied will, I imagine, turn a significant number of potential users (test subjects) off completing their registrations

On the upside, youâ€™re getting consistent feedback which should be easy to implement changes to resolve. /facepalm",2019-03-13T21:27:07-07:00,1
